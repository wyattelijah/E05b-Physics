# E05b-Physics
In this exercise we played with 2D physics and how to implement them

In main1 we added gravity so that all the balls would drop straight to the bottom of the  window

In main2 we added a bounce mechanic that made the balls bounce until they eventually stopped

In main3 we played with velocity and collision and made sprites trade velocities on collision and change directions
